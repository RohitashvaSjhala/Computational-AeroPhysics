# Computational-AeroPhysics
This repository contains a combination of C and C++ coded files that are used to perform high-speed aerodynamics calculations on various geometrical bodies, mainly on Soviet Union re-entry crew vehicle. Using Techplot software, you can visually see the pressure contours for various angle of attacks.
