# Computational-AeroPhysics
This repository contains a combination of C and C++ coded files that are used to perform high-speed aerodynamics calculations on various geometrical bodies, mainly on Soviet Union re-entry crew vehicle. 
The input files for these codes are generated from the G-mash software in the text file format depending upon the type of geometry created within the software.
Using Techplot software, you can visually see the pressure contours for the output file generated, on various angles of attack.
